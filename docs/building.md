# Building PARETO UI

This document covers local development builds and the GitHub Actions build workflow for PARETO UI.

The parent model is pinned to a tested commit in
[backend/requirements.txt](../backend/requirements.txt). To upgrade it, change that
pin and run the [workflow regression checks](scenario-validation.md#verification)
on Linux and Windows before publishing a build.

Install CBC through `idaes get-extensions` as shown below. The app uses its
full-precision NL/ASL interface so solution-file rounding cannot alter water balances.

## Repository layout

- `backend/`: FastAPI backend packaged with PyInstaller for desktop builds.
- `electron/`: Electron shell, Electron Builder config, and desktop packaging scripts.
- `electron/ui/`: React frontend.
- `.github/workflows/app_build_dispatch.yml`: manual GitHub Actions entry point for packaged builds.
- `.github/workflows/app_build.yml`: reusable workflow that performs the actual packaged build.

## Local prerequisites

- Conda or Miniforge.
- Git.
- Windows for Windows installers, macOS for macOS DMGs, and Linux for Linux packages.
- Apple signing credentials only if you are producing a signed/notarized macOS build locally.

The repository's Conda environment installs Python and Node.js. Python package dependencies are installed separately from `backend/requirements.txt`.

## First-time local setup

From the repository root:

```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate pareto-ui-env
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
idaes get-extensions --verbose
npm --prefix electron clean-install
npm --prefix electron/ui clean-install
```

Create a local frontend environment file:

```bash
cat > electron/ui/.env <<'EOF'
REACT_APP_PARETO_VERSION=main
REACT_APP_BUILD_NUMBER=local
EOF
```

`electron/ui/.env` is ignored by Git. `REACT_APP_PARETO_VERSION` is used by the app when linking to Project PARETO sample files, so set it to the Project PARETO branch or tag you want to test against.

## Running locally

Activate the Conda environment first:

```bash
conda activate pareto-ui-env
```

Run the backend and frontend in a browser:

```bash
npm --prefix electron/ui run app-start
```

Run the backend, frontend, and Electron shell:

```bash
npm --prefix electron/ui run electron-start
```

The frontend development server uses Create React App defaults. The backend starts with Uvicorn on port `50011`.

## TypeScript linting and formatting

ESLint uses the existing Create React App rules for React and TypeScript. Existing
warnings remain nonblocking; lint errors fail CI. Two test-style rules are warnings
instead of errors. Prettier handles formatting separately, following its
[ESLint integration guidance](https://prettier.io/docs/integrating-with-linters).
No strict typing or naming rules are added. ESLint stays on version 8 to match
Create React App's supported peer dependency.

From the repository root:

```bash
npm --prefix electron/ui run lint
npm --prefix electron/ui run lint:fix
npm --prefix electron/ui run format:file -- src/services/contracts/collection.ts
```

`format:file` accepts one or more paths relative to `electron/ui`. Use
`npm --prefix electron/ui run format` to format all TypeScript under `src` and
`cypress`, or `npm --prefix electron/ui run format:check` to check those files
without editing. The existing source has mixed formatting, so the repository-wide
format check will report files until they are formatted. It is not a CI gate.
Format files as you work on them to keep unrelated changes out of a PR.

The checked-in Prettier configuration uses two spaces, single quotes, semicolons,
trailing commas, and a 100-column print width. VS Code recommends the ESLint and
Prettier extensions and enables TypeScript formatting on save once Prettier is
installed. The editor and command line use the same local formatter version.

## Local packaged builds

The local packaged build scripts are defined in `electron/package.json`.

Windows:

```bash
cd electron
npm run dist:win
```

macOS:

```bash
cd electron
npm run dist:mac
```

Linux:

```bash
cd electron
npm run dist:lin
```

Build output is written to `electron/dist/`. The local Windows build does not use the GitHub Actions Google Cloud KMS signing flow; that signing flow runs in CI after Electron Builder creates the Windows artifact.

For startup memory growth in packaged builds, see the
[investigation and release checks](packaged-memory.md). Rebuild both the backend
and frontend to include the Python startup guard and Electron process cleanup.

## GitHub Actions builds

Use `.github/workflows/app_build_dispatch.yml` for CI builds. It calls `.github/workflows/app_build.yml`, which performs setup, backend build, frontend build, packaging, optional macOS signing/notarization, optional Windows signing, and artifact upload.

Run a signed Windows NSIS build from the GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh workflow run app_build_dispatch.yml \
  --repo project-pareto/pareto-ui \
  --ref main \
  -f os-version=windows-latest \
  -f project-pareto-repo=project-pareto/project-pareto \
  -f project-pareto-branch=main \
  -f project-pareto-version=main \
  -f sign-distribution=true \
  -f windows-installer-target=nsis
```

Run an unsigned Windows build:

```bash
gh workflow run app_build_dispatch.yml \
  --repo project-pareto/pareto-ui \
  --ref main \
  -f os-version=windows-latest \
  -f sign-distribution=false \
  -f windows-installer-target=nsis
```

Run a macOS DMG build:

```bash
gh workflow run app_build_dispatch.yml \
  --repo project-pareto/pareto-ui \
  --ref main \
  -f os-version=macos-latest \
  -f project-pareto-branch=main \
  -f project-pareto-version=main \
  -f sign-distribution=true
```

Optional workflow inputs:

- `package-build-number`: overrides the generated build number. If omitted, CI uses `YY.MM.DD`.
- `project-pareto-repo`: Project PARETO repository to clone and install.
- `project-pareto-branch`: Project PARETO branch or tag to install.
- `project-pareto-version`: value embedded in the frontend for display and sample-file links.
- `windows-installer-target`: `nsis`, `portable`, or `zip`.
- `sign-distribution`: set to `false` for unsigned test builds.

Windows artifact names:

- NSIS: `PARETO-UI_<build-number>_win64_nsis.exe`
- Portable executable: `PARETO-UI_<build-number>_win64_portable.exe`
- Zip target: uploaded as the `PARETO-UI_<build-number>_win64_portable` artifact directory

macOS artifact name:

- `PARETO-UI_<build-number>_arm64.dmg`

## Windows code signing

Signed Windows builds require the Google Cloud KMS setup documented in [Windows Code Signing With Google Cloud KMS](windows-code-signing-google-cloud-kms.md).

If the signing repository variables are absent, a Windows build with `sign-distribution: true` continues unsigned. If only part of the signing configuration is present, the workflow fails early so release builds do not silently publish with a broken signing setup.
